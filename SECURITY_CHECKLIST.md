## ðŸ”’ Security Best Practices

### For Contributors
1. **Never commit sensitive files**:
   - `local.properties`
   - `google-services.json`
   - `keystore.properties`
   - Any file containing API keys or secrets

2. **Use environment variables** for CI/CD:
   - Store API keys in GitHub Secrets
   - Use environment-specific configuration files

3. **Review dependencies** regularly:
   - Check for security vulnerabilities
   - Update dependencies promptly
   - Use dependency scanning tools

### For Maintainers
1. **Regular security audits**:
   - Review all dependencies monthly
   - Check for exposed secrets in commit history
   - Monitor security advisories

2. **Access control**:
   - Limit repository access to trusted contributors
   - Use branch protection rules
   - Require security reviews for sensitive changes

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Set up alerts for dependency vulnerabilities
   - Monitor for exposed secrets
   - Regular security scanning

## ðŸš¨ Emergency Response

If sensitive information is accidentally committed:

1. **Immediate actions**:
   - Remove the file from the repository
   - Revoke any exposed API keys
   - Change passwords/secrets if necessary

2. **Clean up**:
   - Use `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner
   - Force push to remove from history
   - Notify team members

3. **Prevention**:
   - Update `.gitignore` if needed
   - Add pre-commit hooks
   - Review commit process
